                    Hello, my name is Kaya Pollack. I grew up in Athens, Georgia. Being the proud Athenian I am, led me to pursue a degree in psychology 
                    at the University of Georgia. It is my hope to pursue a clinical psychology graduate degree, and my dream to open my own clinic whose priority
                    is to serve historically underrepresented and underserved minority populations. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Growing up in Athens, I saw the strict divide between the Title  One schools that I attended all my life, and the Research One institution that
                    was just down the street. Although I fell into the trap of going to the affordable college in my area, I lucked out on it being prestigious. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    During my time at UGA, I have continuously educated students and faculty alike on the effects, repercussions, and history that they knowingly, 
                    and unknowingly, play into by being a part of the UGA community. It is here where I learned the importance of educating all who would listen—not 
                    only to see personal change, but political change and the increase of outreach to the community as an ally and not as a charity case.
